AEIOU game is a java game project that has inspired by the first game of the Korean series squid game (2021) which is based on a school game, where one player calls out a ‘green light’ indicating to the group behind them to run, or ‘red light’, which means everyone must stop. If you move after the ‘red light’ is announced, you lose but we have modified the rules to an A E I O U sound starting with A and ending with U
